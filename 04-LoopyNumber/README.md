Write a program that asks the user for a number and says whether or not it
is the lucky number. Make the lucky number 7. Provide a hint if the person
is wrong, saying either the lucky number is greater than or less than the user's
guess. Loop until the user gets it right.

Example outputs:

Example 1
```
Show me a number: 5
The lucky number is greater than that! Try again...

Show me a number: 9
The lucky number is less than that! Try again...

Show me a number: 7
You guesssed the lucky number! Good job!
```
